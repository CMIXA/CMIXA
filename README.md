# Hello World, my name is Chris ðŸ‘‹

## I am a front-end developer and designer looking to bring in a new perspective. 
### Some of my interests include: 
- web development, front-end development, back-end development, VR & AR, experimental design, UX & UI, fashion, music, and 3D modeling. 

### Iâ€™ve always seen programming as a tool for creativity and that's what excites me. With that, I want to be a well-rounded developer who is continuously learning!
